It is characterized by a mystical aura and the ability to do magic. A magic stick can be a tool with which a wizard or witch invokes spells, controls magical energies or manipulates reality.  Sticks are sometimes personalized and customized to their owner, sometimes incorporating a core from the pen of a magical creature. They can also be decorated with runes, gemstones or other magical items that enhance their power. In many fantasy worlds, a magic stick is an integral attribute of a character who uses magic, serving as a tool for unleashing powerful spells and summoning supernatural forces.ilove your beloved buy elixir at Felix's")
